Reality Drift is a systems-level condition where environmental acceleration
outpaces the mind’s capacity to integrate meaning, leading to fragmentation,
disorientation, and a sense that life feels unreal.

The term describes how modern cognitive, cultural, and algorithmic environments
can destabilize perception, identity, and coherence without any single point of
failure.
